                <p><b>Note:</b> Translated versions of our Terms Of Use are offered only for informational purposes, and may
                    not always be up-to-date. In case of disagreement between the English and any translated versions of
                    this document, the English version will be the one considered valid and definitive. </p>
                <p><b>Welcome to Kringle.cash - Thank you for visiting.</b></p>

                <p>It is important to us that you, and our other visitors, have the best possible time while using our site,
                    and that when you use this site you are fully aware of our respective legal rights and obligations. For
                    that reason, we have created these Terms of Use as the legally binding terms to govern your use of this
                    site. Please read these Terms of Use carefully before using the site because they affect your legal
                    rights and obligations.</p>

                <p>This agreement ("agreement") is a legal agreement covering the provision of Kringle.cash services
                    ("service" or "services") by Kringle.cash ("Kringle.cash" or "Kringle.cash" or "us" or "our" or "we") to
                    you as an individual ("you" or "your"). Your use of the services will be governed by this agreement,
                    along with the Kringle.cash privacy policy. Please read this agreement carefully before using
                    Kringle.cash. By using the service, you agree to become bound by the terms and conditions of this
                    agreement.</p>

                <p><b>Penalty for Breaking the Membership Agreement</b></p>

                <p>All of your TBC wallets will be suspended without warning for up to six months if submitted documentation
                    proves that you are attempting to or have broken the Membership Agreement. All buying and selling of TBC
                    coins must be done at the Current Price. Selling TBC coins at a discount is strictly forbidden and
                    punishment will be swift and without notice given. All packages of TBC coins sold adding TBC coins as a
                    gift will also be considered a discounting of the price of TBC and will be punished. The foundation of
                    the TBC community is the Membership Agreement and we will not allow anyone to crack it, and have zero
                    tolerance for anyone who attempts to break it.</p>

                    strictly prohibited. If you become involved in any violation of system security, Kringle.cash reserves
                    the right to release your details to system administrators at other sites in order to assist them in

                    occurred, it may edit or modify any submission, posting or e-mails, remove the material permanently,
                    cancel postings, warn users, suspend users and passwords, terminate accounts or take other corrective
                    action it deems appropriate. Kringle.cash will fully co-operate with any law enforcement authorities or
                    court order requesting or directing Kringle.cash to disclose the identity of anyone posting any e-mails,
                    or publishing or otherwise making available any materials that are believed to violate these Terms of
